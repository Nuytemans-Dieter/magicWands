*Note: You must be using Lombok if you wish to contribute, as many methods are annotated with it and will cause errors if you're not using it! See dependencies for more.*

## Dependencies
This is built with Spigot's latest version and Project Lombok. See Lombok installation [here](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij).


## How it will work
This plugin will work in a Player -> Wand(s) -> Spells relationship. This means that players can have multiple wands, and each wand will have multiple spells. 

**Example:** Player 1 has a Combat wand, with that wand he has 3 combat spells. He can purchase more combat spells for his wand. Player 1 can also buy a transformation wand, and can buy transformation spells for that wand.
